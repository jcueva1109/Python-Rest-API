# Python-Rest-API

First things first
1. This first commit is just to save my first ever Django Rest API. This was made using a tutorial I found on the internet. 
With this basic knowledge I now have the basic foundation about what is Django and its framework. 

2. Now on to the real task. Wish me luck. ü§û
